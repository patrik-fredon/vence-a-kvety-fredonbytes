# Product Customization and Checkout Enhancements Spec - 2025-01-10

## Spec Created

Successfully created a comprehensive spec for product customization and checkout enhancements at:
`.kiro/specs/product-customization-and-checkout-enhancements/`

## Spec Components

### 1. Requirements Document (`requirements.md`)
- 10 major requirements with detailed acceptance criteria in EARS format
- Covers DateSelector UI improvements, delivery method selection, and Stripe Embedded Checkout
- Includes performance, security, localization, and testing requirements

### 2. Design Document (`design.md`)
- Comprehensive architecture with Mermaid diagrams
- Component interfaces and data models
- Error handling strategy with retry logic
- Redis caching strategy (30min TTL)
- Security considerations (PCI compliance, CSRF protection)
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Full Czech/English localization
- Phased deployment strategy with rollback plan

### 3. Tasks Document (`tasks.md`)
- 15 major tasks with 54 sub-tasks
- Logical implementation sequence
- Testing tasks marked as optional (*)
- Each task references specific requirements

## Key Features

### DateSelector Improvements
- Remove input message field
- Add customizable header prop
- Use "Order date" as standard header
- Maintain all calendar functionality

### Delivery Method Selection
- New DeliveryMethodSelector component
- Two options: "Delivery to address" (free) and "Personal pickup"
- Integration with existing customization system
- Database migration for delivery method tracking

### Stripe Embedded Checkout
- Modern embedded payment flow
- Redis caching for checkout sessions (30min TTL)
- Proper error handling with retry logic
- Integration with existing Stripe product/price IDs
- Follows official Stripe Embedded Checkout documentation

## Technical Highlights

### Caching Strategy
- Cart-based cache keys using SHA-256 hash
- 30-minute TTL for checkout sessions
- Automatic invalidation on completion/cancellation
- Graceful fallback on cache failures

### Error Handling
- Categorized errors (validation, Stripe API, cache, database)
- Localized error messages (Czech/English)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- User-friendly recovery options

### Performance
- Lazy loading for Stripe SDK and checkout components
- Code splitting for optimal bundle size
- Cache warming for popular products
- Loading states throughout

### Security
- PCI compliance via Stripe Embedded Checkout
- CSRF protection for checkout endpoints
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Webhook signature verification

## Database Changes

Migration: `20250110000000_add_delivery_method_support.sql`
- Add `delivery_method` column to orders table
- Add `pickup_location` column to orders table
- Create index for delivery method queries
- Update existing orders with default delivery method

## New Files to Create

### Components
- `src/components/product/DeliveryMethodSelector.tsx`
- `src/components/payments/StripeEmbeddedCheckout.tsx`

### Services
- `src/lib/stripe/embedded-checkout.ts`
- `src/lib/stripe/error-handler.ts`

### API Routes
- `src/app/api/checkout/create-session/route.ts`

### Migrations
- `supabase/migrations/20250110000000_add_delivery_method_support.sql`

## Translation Keys to Add

Both `messages/cs.json` and `messages/en.json`:
- `product.orderDate`
- `product.deliveryMethod.*`
- `checkout.loading`
- `checkout.processing`
- `checkout.success`
- `checkout.error.*`

## Next Steps

To start implementation:
1. Open `.kiro/specs/product-customization-and-checkout-enhancements/tasks.md`
2. Click "Start task" next to task 1 (Setup and Configuration)
3. Follow the task sequence for systematic implementation

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: DateSelector and Delivery Method (Low Risk)
- Deploy UI changes
- A/B test with 10% of users

### Phase 2: Stripe Embedded Checkout (Medium Risk)
- Deploy with feature flag
- Gradual rollout: 10% â†’ 25% â†’ 50% â†’ 100%

### Phase 3: Database Migration (Low Risk)
- Run in staging first
- Deploy during low-traffic period

## Monitoring

Key metrics to track:
- Checkout session creation time
- Cache hit rate
- Payment success rate
- Error rate by type
- Delivery method selection distribution

## Status

âœ… Requirements document created and approved
âœ… Design document created and approved
âœ… Tasks document created and approved
ðŸŽ¯ Ready for implementation

The spec is complete and ready for execution. All documents follow the spec-driven development methodology with clear requirements, comprehensive design, and actionable implementation tasks.
