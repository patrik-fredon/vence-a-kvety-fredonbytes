# Task 5: Database Schema Updates - Completion Summary

**Date:** January 10, 2025
**Task:** Database Schema Updates for Delivery Method Support
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Overview
Successfully implemented database schema updates and TypeScript type definitions to support delivery method selection (delivery vs pickup) in the orders system.

## Completed Sub-tasks

### 5.1 Create Delivery Method Migration
**File Created:** `supabase/migrations/20250110000000_add_delivery_method_support.sql`

**Changes Made:**
- Added `delivery_method` column to orders table with CHECK constraint ('delivery' or 'pickup')
- Added `pickup_location` column for storing pickup location details
- Created index `idx_orders_delivery_method` for optimized queries
- Updated existing orders with default 'delivery' method for backward compatibility
- Added documentation comments for the new columns

**Migration Features:**
- Idempotent (uses IF NOT EXISTS)
- Backward compatible (updates existing records)
- Performance optimized (includes index)
- Well documented

### 5.2 Update TypeScript Types for Delivery Method
**Files Modified:**
1. `src/types/order.ts`
2. `src/types/product.ts`

**Changes Made:**

#### Order Types (`src/types/order.ts`):
- Updated `OrderRow` interface to include:
  - `delivery_method: 'delivery' | 'pickup' | null`
  - `pickup_location: string | null`
- Updated `Order` interface to include:
  - `deliveryMethod?: 'delivery' | 'pickup'`
  - `pickupLocation?: string`

#### Product Types (`src/types/product.ts`):
- Extended `CustomizationType` to include `"delivery_method"`
- Created new `DeliveryMethodOption` interface that extends `CustomizationOption`
- Defined delivery method choices structure with proper typing

**New Interface:**
```typescript
export interface DeliveryMethodOption extends CustomizationOption {
  type: "delivery_method";
  choices: [
    {
      id: "delivery_address";
      label: LocalizedContent;
      priceModifier: 0; // Free delivery
    },
    {
      id: "personal_pickup";
      label: LocalizedContent;
      priceModifier: 0;
    }
  ];
}
```

## Verification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful (`npm run type-check`)
- ✅ No type errors introduced
- ✅ All existing types remain compatible
- ✅ Migration follows existing patterns

## Requirements Satisfied
- ✅ Requirement 5.5: Database schema changes with proper migrations
- ✅ Requirement 9.1: Store delivery method in order record
- ✅ Requirement 9.2: Store pickup location if applicable
- ✅ Requirement 5.2: TypeScript type safety maintained
- ✅ Requirement 5.6: Proper type definitions for new features

## Integration Points
The changes integrate seamlessly with:
1. Existing order management system
2. Cart and checkout flow
3. Product customization system
4. Database query patterns

## Next Steps
The following tasks can now proceed:
- Task 6: Stripe Embedded Checkout Service (can use delivery method in metadata)
- Task 8: Checkout Page Integration (can validate delivery method)
- Task 10: Order Management Updates (can display delivery method)
- Task 11: Cart Updates for Delivery Method (can validate selection)

## Notes
- Migration is ready to be run in staging/production
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Backward compatible with existing orders
- Type definitions support both delivery and pickup scenarios
