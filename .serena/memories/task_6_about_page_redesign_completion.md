  - Large: `lg:w-72` (288px)
- Proper spacing with `mb-16` margin

### 6.3 Replaced Decorative Elements with Gold-Outlined Cards ✅

- Updated decorative dots to use `bg-amber-300` instead of `bg-funeral-gold`

### 6.4 Responsive Layout Testing ✅
- Mobile layout: `grid-cols-1` (single column)
- Tablet layout: `md:grid-cols-2` (two columns)
- Desktop layout: `lg:grid-cols-3` (three columns)
- Gap spacing: `gap-6` for better visual separation
- All images maintain `aspect-square` ratio

## Design Decisions
1. **Logo Placement**: Positioned between main image and story content for visual flow
2. **Gold-Outlined Cards**: Used `border-amber-300` with semi-transparent `teal-800/50` background for elegant, funeral-appropriate design
3. **Hover Effects**: Subtle border color change to `amber-200` for interactive feedback
4. **Image Priority**: Added `priority` flag to hero image and logo for optimal LCP
5. **Removed AboutCard Component**: Replaced with direct div elements for more control over styling

## TypeScript Verification
