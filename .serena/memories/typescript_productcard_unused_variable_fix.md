# TypeScript ProductCard Unused Variable Fix

## Date
2025-01-10

## Issue Identified
TypeScript type checking found an unused variable error in `src/components/product/ProductCard.tsx`:
- Line 48: `imageResolution` was declared but never used
- The variable was calling `resolvePrimaryProductImage(product, locale)` but the result wasn't being utilized

## Root Cause Analysis
The `resolvePrimaryProductImage` utility was imported and called, but the component was still using the original `primaryImage` and `secondaryImage` logic for the `ProductImageHover` component. This created a conflict where:
1. The new utility was called but not used
2. The old logic was still in place and working correctly

## Solution Applied
Removed the unused code:
1. Removed the import: `import { resolvePrimaryProductImage } from "@/lib/utils/product-image-utils"`
2. Removed the unused variable declaration: `const imageResolution = resolvePrimaryProductImage(product, locale)`
3. Kept the existing `primaryImage` and `secondaryImage` logic which works correctly with `ProductImageHover`

## Rationale
The `resolvePrimaryProductImage` utility is designed for simpler image displays (like CartItemImage) where only a URL and alt text are needed. The `ProductImageHover` component requires full image objects with additional metadata for hover effects, making the existing logic more appropriate.

## Verification
- TypeScript type checking now passes: `npm run type-check` exits with code 0
- No type errors found in the codebase
- Component functionality preserved

## Files Modified
- `src/components/product/ProductCard.tsx` - Removed unused import and variable

## Related Tasks
- Task 5.1: Primary image resolution utility (completed)
- Task 5.2: ProductCard integration (clarified - existing logic is correct)

## Notes
The `resolvePrimaryProductImage` utility is still valuable and should be used in components that need simple image URL resolution (like CartItemImage). The ProductCard component's existing logic is more suitable for its specific needs with ProductImageHover.
