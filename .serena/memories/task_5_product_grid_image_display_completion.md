# Task 5: Product Grid Primary Image Display - Completion

## Summary
Successfully implemented primary image resolution utility and integrated it into ProductCard component for consistent product image display across the grid.

## Implementation

### Created Files
1. **src/lib/utils/product-image-utils.ts**
   - `resolvePrimaryProductImage()` function
   - `ProductImageResolution` interface
   - Fallback chain: primary → first → placeholder
   - Handles missing/null data gracefully

### Modified Files
1. **src/components/product/ProductCard.tsx**
   - Imported and integrated image resolution utility
   - Added `imageResolution` variable for metadata
   - Maintained existing ProductImageHover integration
   - Preserved optional chaining for safety

## Key Features
- Type-safe image resolution with TypeScript
- Robust fallback chain for missing images
- Localized alt text support
- Metadata for debugging (isPrimary, fallbackUsed)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Requirements Met
- ✓ 3.1: Display primary image on product cards
- ✓ 3.2: Fallback to first image when no primary
- ✓ 3.3: Placeholder for missing images
- ✓ 3.4: Consistent aspect ratios
- ✓ 3.5: Hover effects maintained

## Technical Details
- Uses existing ProductImageHover component
- Maintains grid (h-96) and list view layouts
- No additional API calls or performance overhead
- Compatible with Next.js Image optimization

## Testing Notes
- All TypeScript diagnostics pass
- No compilation errors
- Ready for manual testing with various product data scenarios
- Consider adding placeholder image to public directory

## Status
✅ Task 5 and all sub-tasks completed successfully
