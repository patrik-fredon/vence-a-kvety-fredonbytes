# Product Slug 404 Error Analysis

## Issue Summary
User reported 404 error when accessing: `http://localhost:3000/en/products/hearth-for-urn-wreath`

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Routing Configuration**: ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY
   - Dynamic route exists at `src/app/[locale]/products/[slug]/page.tsx`
   - Route properly handles locale and slug parameters
   - Uses `force-dynamic` configuration for server-side rendering
   - Correctly calls `notFound()` when product not found

2. **Database Query**: ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY
   - Query searches for product by slug with `active = true`
   - Includes proper category joins and data transformation
   - Has caching layer with fallback to database

3. **Product Data**: ❌ PRODUCT DOESN'T EXIST
   - Searched seed data in `src/lib/supabase/enhanced-seed-data.sql`
   - Found existing products with slugs like:
     - `classic-white-funeral-wreath`
     - `heart-wreath-red-roses`
     - `pink-mourning-wreath-lilies`
     - `modern-asymmetric-wreath`
   - **The slug `hearth-for-urn-wreath` does not exist in the database**

## Conclusion
The 404 error is correct behavior. The routing system is working properly, but the requested product doesn't exist in the database.

## Solutions
1. **Add the missing product** to the database seed data
2. **Verify business requirements** - should this product exist?
3. **Check for typos** - user might have meant a different existing product
4. **Implement better error handling** with product suggestions

## Technical Details
- Route: `src/app/[locale]/products/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Database table: `products`
- Seed file: `src/lib/supabase/enhanced-seed-data.sql`
- Cache functions: `getCachedProductBySlug()`, `cacheProductBySlug()`
