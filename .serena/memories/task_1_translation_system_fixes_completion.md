# Task 1: Translation System Fixes - Completion Summary

## Date
2025-10-04

## Task Overview
Fixed translation system by adding missing Czech and English translation keys as specified in the vence-kvety-refactor spec.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Missing Translation Keys

#### Czech Translation File (`messages/cs.json`)
Added the following keys to `home.refactoredHero`:
- `subheading`: "Krásné květinové aranžmá pro důstojné rozloučení"
- `cta`: "Prohlédnout věnce"
- `ctaAriaLabel`: "Přejít na stránku s pohřebními věnci"

Added to `accessibility`:
- `accessibility`: "Přístupnost"

#### English Translation File (`messages/en.json`)
Added the following keys to `home.refactoredHero`:
- `subheading`: "Beautiful floral arrangements for dignified farewell"
- `cta`: "Browse Wreaths"
- `ctaAriaLabel`: "Navigate to funeral wreaths page"

Added to `accessibility`:
- `accessibility`: "Accessibility"

### 2. Updated Fallback Utilities

Updated `src/lib/utils/fallback-utils.ts` to include the new translation keys in both English and Czech fallback translations. This ensures that if the translation system fails, users will still see appropriate text.

## Validation Performed

### 1. JSON Validation
- ✅ Verified both `messages/cs.json` and `messages/en.json` are valid JSON
- ✅ No syntax errors introduced

### 2. Translation Key Validation
- ✅ All 4 required keys present in both locales:
  - `home.refactoredHero.subheading`
  - `home.refactoredHero.cta`
  - `home.refactoredHero.ctaAriaLabel`
  - `accessibility.accessibility`

### 3. Translation Structure Consistency
- ✅ Both locales have 594 keys total
- ✅ No structural differences between Czech and English
- ✅ Perfect key parity maintained

### 4. Fallback System Testing
- ✅ Valid keys return correct translations
- ✅ Missing keys return fallback values
- ✅ Errors are caught and fallback is used
- ✅ All test cases passed

### 5. Build Validation
- ✅ TypeScript type checking passed with no errors
- ✅ Next.js production build completed successfully
- ✅ All 45 pages generated without issues

## Requirements Satisfied

From `.kiro/specs/vence-kvety-refactor/requirements.md`:

### Requirement 1.1 ✅
**WHEN the website loads in Czech locale THEN all translation keys SHALL resolve to proper Czech text without console errors**
- All missing keys have been added to Czech locale

### Requirement 1.2 ✅
**WHEN accessing the hero section THEN the keys `home.refactoredHero.subheading`, `home.refactoredHero.cta`, and `home.refactoredHero.ctaAriaLabel` SHALL display translated content**
- All three keys added to both locales

### Requirement 1.3 ✅
**WHEN the accessibility toolbar is rendered THEN the key `tAccessibility("accessibility")` SHALL resolve correctly**
- `accessibility.accessibility` key added to both locales

### Requirement 1.4 ✅
**IF a translation key is missing THEN the system SHALL provide a meaningful fallback instead of displaying the raw key**
- Fallback utilities updated with all new keys
- Fallback system tested and verified working

### Requirement 1.5 ✅
**WHEN switching between Czech and English locales THEN all content SHALL display correctly in both languages**
- Both locales have identical structure with 594 keys each
- All new keys properly translated in both languages

## Files Modified

1. `messages/cs.json` - Added 4 new translation keys
2. `messages/en.json` - Added 4 new translation keys
3. `src/lib/utils/fallback-utils.ts` - Updated fallback translations for both locales

## Testing Notes

- No console errors expected when loading pages
- Hero section will now display all text properly
- Accessibility toolbar footer link will display correctly
- Fallback system provides graceful degradation if translation system fails

## Next Steps

Task 1 is complete. Ready to proceed with Task 2: Standardize typography colors globally.
