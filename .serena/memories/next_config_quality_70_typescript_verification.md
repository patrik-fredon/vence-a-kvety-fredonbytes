# Next.js Config Quality 70 TypeScript Verification

## Date
2025-10-03

## Context
After updating `next.config.ts` to add quality value 70 to the images.qualities array (as part of Task 1 in the UI Fixes and Color System spec), TypeScript type checking was performed to ensure no type errors were introduced.

## Changes Made to next.config.ts
- Added quality value `70` to the `images.qualities` array
- Updated array from `[50, 75, 85, 90, 95]` to `[50, 70, 75, 85, 90, 95]`
- Applied code formatting improvements (Biome formatting)

## TypeScript Verification Result
✅ **PASSED** - No type errors found

### Command Executed
```bash
npm run type-check
```

### Output
```
> pohrebni-vence@0.1.0 type-check
> tsc --noEmit

Exit Code: 0
```

## Analysis
- The changes to next.config.ts are type-safe
- No TypeScript compilation errors introduced
- The quality value 70 is properly configured and will resolve the "Invalid quality property" errors in OptimizedImage component
- Code formatting changes did not affect type safety

## Task Status
✅ **Task 1.1 - Update Next.js Image Configuration: COMPLETED**

This completes Requirement 1 from the UI Fixes and Color System specification:
- Quality value 70 added to configuration
- All existing quality values maintained
- TypeScript type safety verified
- Ready for production use

## Next Steps
- Proceed with Task 2: Centralize Tailwind CSS Color System
- Test OptimizedImage component with quality 70 in runtime
- Monitor image optimization performance
