# Webhook Handler Enhancement Implementation

## Completed Task
Task 3: Webhook Handler Enhancement for Stripe Embedded Checkout Enhancement

## Date
January 10, 2025

## What Was Done

### 3.1 Webhook Event Deduplication
- Implemented `checkDuplicateEvent()` function to query `webhook_events` table
- Checks for existing event_id before processing
- Returns early with success if duplicate detected
- Handles database errors gracefully (assumes not duplicate on error)
- Uses database unique constraint for race condition protection

### 3.2 Webhook Event Recording
- Enhanced `markEventProcessed()` function to record events in database
- Stores event_id, event_type, status ('success' or 'failed'), error_message, and payload
- Handles duplicate key errors gracefully (race condition protection)
- Records both successful and failed events
- Doesn't throw errors to avoid failing webhooks on recording issues

### 3.3 Enhanced checkout.session.completed Handler
- Added comprehensive structured logging with context objects
- Enhanced error handling with detailed error messages
- Validates order items and customer data
- Logs warnings for missing data (e.g., missing productId, missing email)
- Improved error context preservation with stack traces
- Better validation of line items before order creation

### 3.4 Email Notifications Integration
- Replaced stub `sendOrderConfirmationEmail()` with full implementation
- Integrates with existing `@/lib/email/order-notifications` service
- Sends both customer confirmation and admin notification emails concurrently
- Handles email failures gracefully without failing order creation
- Logs email sending results (success/failure) with message IDs
- Passes order data to email function to avoid extra database queries
- Supports both Czech and English locales

### 3.5 Payment Status Tracking Enhancement
- Enhanced `updateOrderPaymentStatus()` with better status mapping
- Added comprehensive logging for all payment status updates
- Enhanced all payment intent handlers:
  - `handlePaymentSuccess()` - logs success with transaction details
  - `handlePaymentFailure()` - logs error code, type, and message
  - `handleRequiresAction()` - logs next action type
  - `handlePaymentCanceled()` - logs cancellation reason
  - `handlePaymentProcessing()` - logs payment method types
- All handlers now include structured logging with context objects
- Proper mapping of payment statuses to order statuses

### 3.6 Error Handling and Logging Improvements
- Enhanced POST handler with nested try-catch for better error isolation
- Records failed events in webhook_events table with error details
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes:
  - 400 for signature verification failures (non-retryable)
  - 500 for processing errors (triggers Stripe retry)
  - 200 for successful processing
- All error logs include:
  - Event ID and type
  - Error message and stack trace
  - Relevant context (order ID, session ID, etc.)
- Structured logging throughout with consistent format
- Error context preservation for debugging

## Files Modified
- `src/app/api/payments/webhook/stripe/route.ts` - Enhanced webhook handler with all improvements

## Key Features Implemented
1. **Idempotency** - Duplicate event detection prevents reprocessing
2. **Event Tracking** - All events recorded in database with status and payload
3. **Email Automation** - Customer and admin emails sent automatically
4. **Comprehensive Logging** - Structured logs with full context for debugging
5. **Error Resilience** - Graceful error handling, email failures don't fail orders
6. **Payment Status Tracking** - All payment intent events properly handled and logged
7. **Proper HTTP Status Codes** - Correct responses for Stripe retry logic

## Requirements Satisfied
- ✅ 1.2, 1.3: Event deduplication with database unique constraint
- ✅ 1.4, 1.5: Comprehensive error logging with context
- ✅ 1.6: Webhook event recording with full payload
- ✅ 2.1-2.8: Order creation from checkout.session.completed
- ✅ 3.1, 3.6: Customer confirmation emails
- ✅ 4.1, 4.5: Admin notification emails
- ✅ 7.1-7.6: Payment status tracking for all payment intent events
- ✅ 8.1-8.4: Error handling with proper HTTP status codes

## Testing Recommendations
1. Use Stripe CLI to trigger test webhook events
2. Verify duplicate event detection works
3. Test email sending for both customer and admin
4. Verify all payment intent event types are handled
5. Check error logging includes full context
6. Verify proper HTTP status codes are returned

## Next Steps
The next task in the implementation plan is "4. Cart Cleanup Service" which involves implementing automated cleanup of abandoned carts after 24 hours.
