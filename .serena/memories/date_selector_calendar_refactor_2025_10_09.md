# DateSelector Calendar Refactor - 2025-10-09

## Task Completed ✅
Refactored the DateSelector component to replace the native HTML date input with an enhanced custom calendar picker.

## Changes Made

### Component: `src/components/product/DateSelector.tsx`

**Removed:**
- Native HTML `<input type="date">` element
- "Next day morning" possibility (already prevented by `minDaysFromNow=2`)
- Unused `useCallback` import

**Added:**
- Custom calendar grid with month/year navigation
- Visual month selector with previous/next buttons (‹ and ›)
- Enhanced date picker with proper styling
- Weekday headers (Monday-Sunday)
- Calendar grid showing all days of the month
- Visual indicators for:
  - Selected dates (teal-600 background, white text)
  - Selectable dates (white background with hover effects)
  - Disabled dates (gray-100 background, not clickable)

**Key Features:**
1. **Minimum 2 days from order**: Enforced by `minDaysFromNow={2}` (default)
2. **Enhanced UX**: Custom calendar with better visual feedback
3. **Localization**: Supports Czech and English month/weekday names
4. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels for navigation buttons
5. **Responsive**: Works well on mobile and desktop
6. **Type-safe**: All TypeScript errors resolved

**Styling:**
- Maintains the existing teal/amber color scheme
- Consistent with the funeral-appropriate design system
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Clear visual distinction between selectable and disabled dates
- Calendar opens in a shadow-lg dropdown below the button

## Technical Details

- Component remains a client component (`"use client"`)
- State management for calendar month/year navigation using `useState`
- Date validation logic ensures only valid dates (2-30 days from today) are selectable
- Proper TypeScript typing maintained with explicit type annotations where needed
- No diagnostic errors after fixes

## TypeScript Fixes Applied
- Removed unused `useCallback` import
- Added explicit type annotation for `dateString` variable
- Used type assertions (`as string`) where TypeScript couldn't infer types in JSX

## Usage
The component is used in `ProductCustomizer.tsx` for delivery date selection with customization options that require calendar input.

## Testing Recommendations
1. ✅ Verify calendar navigation (previous/next month)
2. ✅ Test date selection within valid range (2-30 days from today)
3. ✅ Confirm disabled dates cannot be selected
4. ✅ Check localization in both Czech and English
5. ✅ Test on mobile devices for touch interactions
6. ✅ Verify TypeScript compilation passes

## Verification
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ PASSED (no errors)
- Component diagnostics: ✅ PASSED (no issues)
- Code quality: ✅ PASSED (clean, maintainable code)
