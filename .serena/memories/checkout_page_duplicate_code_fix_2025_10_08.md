# Checkout Page Duplicate Code Fix - 2025-10-08

## Issue
The file `src/app/[locale]/checkout/CheckoutPageClient.tsx` had duplicate code at the end. The entire return statement and function body was duplicated starting at line 133, causing TypeScript compilation error:
```
error TS1128: Declaration or statement expected.
```

## Root Cause
During a previous edit, the file was accidentally truncated and then had duplicate content appended, resulting in:
1. Complete function ending at line 131
2. Duplicate code starting at line 133 with `const subtotal = items.reduce...` and the entire return statement

## Fix Applied
Removed all duplicate code after line 131 using regex replacement:
```regex
      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n  const subtotal.*
```

Replaced with:
```typescript
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Related Files Fixed
- `src/components/checkout/steps/PaymentStep.tsx` - Removed unused `ExclamationTriangleIcon` import
- Fixed optional property handling in `PaymentFormWrapper` by using spread operator with conditional inclusion

## Verification
- TypeScript compilation now passes for both files
- No duplicate code remains
- All imports are properly used

## Pattern to Remember
When editing files, always verify the complete file structure after modifications to ensure no duplication or truncation has occurred. Use `wc -l` to check line counts if suspicious.
