# LazyProductQuickView Implementation - October 8, 2025

## Summary
Successfully integrated LazyProductQuickView component into ProductCard (grid and list variants) with properly styled eye icon for quick product preview functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. ProductGridWithCart.tsx
- Added `useState` import for managing quick view modal state
- Added `LazyProductQuickView` import
- Added state: `quickViewProduct` to track which product is being viewed
- Created `handleQuickView` function to open quick view modal
- Created `handleCloseQuickView` function to close quick view modal
- Passed `onQuickView` prop to ProductGrid component
- Rendered LazyProductQuickView component with proper props when a product is selected

### 2. ProductGrid.tsx
- Added `onQuickView?: (product: Product) => void` to ProductGridProps interface
- Added `onQuickView` parameter to ProductGrid component
- Passed `onQuickView` to ProductCard using conditional spread operator to handle undefined case
- Ensured TypeScript strict mode compatibility with `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`

### 3. ProductCard.tsx (No Changes Required)
- Already had `onQuickView` prop defined in ProductCardProps
- Already had eye icon button implemented in grid and list variants
- Eye icon button already calls `handleQuickView` which triggers the `onQuickView` callback
- Eye icon styling already matches the design system:
  - Amber background with teal text
  - Proper hover states
  - Accessible with aria-label
  - Positioned correctly in price section for both grid and list views

## Implementation Details

### Quick View Flow
1. User clicks eye icon on ProductCard (grid or list view)
2. ProductCard calls `onQuickView(product)` callback
3. ProductGrid passes the callback up to ProductGridWithCart
4. ProductGridWithCart sets `quickViewProduct` state
5. LazyProductQuickView component renders with the selected product
6. Modal displays product details with image gallery
7. User can close modal or navigate to full product page

### Performance Optimizations
- LazyProductQuickView uses dynamic import with loading state
- Component only renders when modal is open (`isOpen` check)
- Reduces initial bundle size by code-splitting the modal
- SSR disabled for quick view (ssr: false) as it's interactive-only

### Styling
- Eye icon button uses funeral theme colors (amber/teal)
- Consistent with existing ProductCard design
- Proper hover and focus states
- Accessible with screen reader labels
- Responsive sizing for different viewports

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test quick view in grid layout (4-column responsive)
2. Test quick view in list layout
3. Verify modal opens/closes correctly
4. Check image gallery navigation in modal
5. Verify "View Details" link navigates correctly
6. Test keyboard navigation and accessibility
7. Verify mobile responsiveness
