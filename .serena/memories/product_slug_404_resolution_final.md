# Product Slug 404 Issue - RESOLVED

## Final Resolution Summary
The issue has been **RESOLVED**. The product `hearth-for-urn-wreath` **DOES EXIST** in the database and the routing system is working correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Initial Misunderstanding**: The product was actually present in the database but the seed data file was outdated
2. **Product Exists**: "Srdce na urnu" / "Heart for urn" with slug `hearth-for-urn-wreath` is the 5th product in the database
3. **Routing System**: ✅ Working correctly at `src/app/[locale]/products/[slug]/page.tsx`

## Solution Implemented
- **Updated seed data file** `src/lib/supabase/enhanced-seed-data.sql` to match the actual database products
- **Added all 8 products** from the user's database:
  1. `classic-round-wreath` - Kulatý věnec
  2. `rectangle-wreath-with-photo` - Obdélník s fotografii  
  3. `full-hearth-wreath` - Plné srdce
  4. `wreath-slanted-hearth` - šikmé srdce
  5. **`hearth-for-urn-wreath`** - Srdce na urnu ⭐ (THE REQUESTED PRODUCT)
  6. `slanted-empty-hearth-wreath` - šikmé prazdne srdce
  7. `flower-for-coffin` - Květina na rakev
  8. `wreath-cross` - Kříž
