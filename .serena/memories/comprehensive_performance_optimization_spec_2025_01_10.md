# Comprehensive Performance Optimization Spec Creation

**Date:** January 10, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Overview

Created a comprehensive performance optimization specification for the Next.js 15 e-commerce application. The spec includes detailed requirements, design, and implementation tasks for optimizing rendering speed, build performance, bundle size, and cross-browser/cross-device performance.

## Spec Location

`.kiro/specs/comprehensive-performance-optimization/`

## Documents Created

### 1. Requirements Document (`requirements.md`)

Defines 12 major requirement areas:

1. **CSS and Styling Optimization** - Critical CSS, TailwindCSS purging, CSS Modules
2. **Component Architecture Optimization** - Server Components, lazy loading, client boundaries
3. **Font Loading Optimization** - Self-hosting, subsetting, font-display strategies
4. **Database and API Optimization** - Indexes, N+1 elimination, caching, connection pooling
5. **Image and Media Optimization** - Responsive images, lazy loading, blur placeholders
6. **Mobile Performance Optimization** - Mobile-first CSS, touch targets, 60fps scrolling
7. **Third-Party Script Optimization** - Async loading, error handling, monitoring
8. **Build and Bundle Optimization** - Bundle analysis, code splitting, build time
9. **Caching and CDN Strategy** - Cache headers, stale-while-revalidate, service worker
10. **Core Web Vitals Optimization** - LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
11. **Cross-Browser Performance** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge parity
12. **Monitoring and Observability** - RUM, alerts, performance dashboards

Each requirement includes user stories and detailed EARS-format acceptance criteria.

### 2. Design Document (`design.md`)

Comprehensive technical design including:

- **Architecture Diagrams** - Mermaid diagrams showing optimization layers
- **Component Interfaces** - TypeScript interfaces for all optimization systems
- **Implementation Patterns** - Code examples for each optimization technique
- **Data Models** - Performance budgets, cache configurations
- **Error Handling** - Fallback strategies and degradation handling
- **Testing Strategy** - Lighthouse CI, Playwright, cross-browser testing
- **Implementation Phases** - 12-week phased rollout plan
- **Success Metrics** - Target metrics and monitoring dashboard

Key design decisions:
- Push client boundaries down to minimize client-side JavaScript
- Implement critical CSS extraction and inline delivery
- Self-host and subset fonts for optimal loading
- Use service worker for offline support
- Implement comprehensive caching strategy
- Set up automated performance monitoring

### 3. Tasks Document (`tasks.md`)

Detailed implementation plan with 13 major tasks and 50+ sub-tasks:

1. **Performance Monitoring Setup** - Baseline metrics, Lighthouse CI, Core Web Vitals tracking
2. **Bundle Analysis Automation** - Size thresholds, baseline comparison, CI integration
3. **CSS Optimization** - Critical CSS, CSS Modules, TailwindCSS optimization
4. **Font Optimization** - Self-hosting, subsetting, next/font configuration
5. **Server Components Refactoring** - Audit, refactor, Suspense boundaries
6. **Database Optimization** - Indexes, N+1 elimination, caching, connection pooling
7. **Image Enhancement** - Responsive srcsets, blur placeholders, priority loading
8. **Mobile Optimization** - Mobile-first CSS, touch targets, mobile-specific features
9. **Third-Party Scripts** - Defer loading, error handling, monitoring optimization
10. **Service Worker** - Caching strategy, registration, invalidation
11. **CDN Strategy** - Cache headers, resource hints, edge caching
12. **Cross-Browser Testing** - Playwright tests, feature detection, fallbacks
13. **Final Validation** - Comprehensive audit, production validation, documentation

Each task includes:
- Clear implementation objectives
- Specific code changes required
- Requirements traceability
- Optional test tasks marked with `*`

## Analysis Performed

### Current State Assessment

**Already Optimized:**
- ✅ Lazy loading for Stripe SDK and delivery method selector
- ✅ Comprehensive webpack bundle splitting configuration
- ✅ Cache warming for Stripe IDs
- ✅ Firefox cross-browser compatibility fixes
- ✅ Image optimization with AVIF/WebP support
- ✅ Security headers and CSP configuration

**Identified Optimization Opportunities:**

1. **CSS Delivery** - Large globals.css (~100+ lines), no critical CSS extraction
2. **Component Architecture** - 100+ "use client" components, many could be Server Components
3. **Font Loading** - No font optimization, using external Google Fonts
4. **Bundle Size** - Main bundle ~250KB, target < 200KB
5. **Database Queries** - Potential N+1 queries, no visible indexes
6. **API Caching** - Limited caching strategy beyond Stripe IDs
7. **Mobile Performance** - Mobile CSS exists but needs audit
8. **Third-Party Scripts** - Need to verify loading strategies
9. **Service Worker** - No PWA/offline capabilities
10. **Monitoring** - Basic monitoring exists but needs enhancement

### Performance Targets

- **LCP**: < 2.5s (currently ~3.5s estimated)
- **FID**: < 100ms (currently ~150ms estimated)
- **CLS**: < 0.1 (currently ~0.15 estimated)
- **Bundle Size**: < 200KB main bundle (currently ~250KB)
- **Lighthouse Score**: > 90 (currently ~75 estimated)
- **Build Time**: < 2 minutes (currently ~3 minutes estimated)

## Technology Stack Considerations

- **Next.js 15** - Leveraging Server Components, streaming, Suspense
- **React 19** - Using concurrent features for better performance
- **TailwindCSS 4** - Optimizing with JIT and purging
- **TypeScript 5** - Maintaining strict type safety
- **Supabase** - Optimizing queries and connection pooling
- **Redis (Upstash)** - Expanding caching strategy
- **Vercel** - Leveraging edge network and image optimization

## Implementation Approach

### Phased Rollout (12 weeks)

- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Foundation - Monitoring, budgets, baseline
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4)**: CSS - Critical CSS, modules, fonts
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6)**: Components - Server Components, lazy loading
- **Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8)**: Database - Indexes, queries, caching
- **Phase 5 (Weeks 9-10)**: Mobile - CSS, images, touch targets
- **Phase 6 (Weeks 11-12)**: Advanced - Service worker, final tuning

### Key Principles

1. **Incremental Progress** - Each task builds on previous work
2. **Measurable Impact** - Every optimization has clear metrics
3. **Production Ready** - No compromises on functionality or appearance
4. **Cross-Browser** - Consistent performance across all browsers
5. **Mobile First** - Prioritize mobile performance
6. **Automated Testing** - CI/CD integration for continuous monitoring

## Next Steps

To begin implementation:

1. Open `.kiro/specs/comprehensive-performance-optimization/tasks.md`
2. Click "Start task" next to task 1 to begin with performance monitoring setup
3. Follow the tasks sequentially for best results
4. Each task completion will be tracked in the tasks.md file

## Files Created
