# Stripe Embedded Checkout Enhancement Spec

## Created
January 9, 2025

## Overview
Comprehensive spec for enhancing the existing Stripe embedded checkout implementation with production-ready features.

## Location
`.kiro/specs/stripe-embedded-checkout-enhancement/`

## Documents
- `requirements.md` - 10 requirements covering webhook processing, order creation, email notifications, cart cleanup, and error handling
- `design.md` - Detailed architecture, components, data models, error handling, and testing strategy
- `tasks.md` - 8 phases with 30 sub-tasks for implementation

## Key Features
1. **Webhook Enhancement** - Event deduplication, comprehensive error handling, payment status tracking
2. **Email System** - Customer and admin notifications using React Email with Supabase SMTP
3. **Cart Cleanup** - Automated cleanup of abandoned carts after 24 hours
4. **Success/Error Pages** - Enhanced user feedback with order details
5. **Environment Configuration** - Validation and documentation of all required variables

## Current State
- Stripe embedded checkout already integrated in PaymentStep.tsx
- Basic webhook handler exists but needs enhancement
- Email sending is stubbed but not implemented
- Cart cleanup is manual

## Implementation Approach
- Build on existing implementation
- Add production-ready features incrementally
- Focus on reliability, error handling, and user experience
- Use React Email for type-safe templates
- Implement retry logic for transient failures

## Technology Stack
- Stripe Node SDK for webhook processing
- Nodemailer with Supabase SMTP for emails
- React Email for email templates
- Redis for cart caching
- Supabase for order storage and webhook event tracking

## Next Steps
User can begin executing tasks by opening tasks.md and clicking "Start task" next to task items.
