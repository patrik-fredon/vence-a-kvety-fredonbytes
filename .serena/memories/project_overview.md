# Project Overview: Pohřební věnce | Ketingmar s.r.o

## Purpose
A premium e-commerce platform for funeral wreaths and floral arrangements serving Czech and international markets. The platform emphasizes dignity, respect, and professionalism during difficult times, providing a compassionate shopping experience for funeral-related products.

## Key Business Context
- **Primary Market**: Czech Republic (Czech language, CZK currency, GoPay payments)
- **Secondary Market**: International (English language, EUR currency, Stripe payments)
- **Product Focus**: Funeral wreaths, floral arrangements, ribbons, customization options
- **Tone Requirements**: ALWAYS respectful, empathetic, professional - NEVER casual or celebratory
- **Color Palette**: Muted, respectful colors (grays, deep blues, soft whites, forest greens)

## Current Status
The project is undergoing a major UI layout migration to match the pohrebni-vence-layout design system. This involves migrating all components from the current design to a new stone/amber color palette with enhanced accessibility and modern design patterns.

## Critical Development Guidelines
- **Sensitive Context**: All code, content, and UI must use respectful, empathetic language
- **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is mandatory (elderly users)
- **Internationalization**: Czech (primary) and English (secondary) with proper fallbacks
- **Performance**: Optimized for Core Web Vitals and mobile-first design
- **Security**: GDPR compliant with comprehensive data protection
