# Navbar Freezing and Performance Issues Analysis

## Problem Summary
The navbar on the products page becomes unresponsive and freezes, with the entire UI becoming sluggish. Users cannot click navbar buttons or navigate away from the products page.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Excessive Core Web Vitals Tracking
**Primary Issue**: Each ProductCard component (12+ on page) initializes its own Core Web Vitals tracking instance.

**Evidence from Console Logs**:
- 12+ instances of "ðŸš€ [CoreWebVitals] Started tracking: ProductCard"
- 12+ instances of "ðŸš€ [CoreWebVitals] Started tracking: ProductCard_Grid_Primary_Image"
- Excessive PerformanceObserver instances
- Multiple web-vitals library imports per component

**Performance Impact**:
- Each instance creates PerformanceObserver listeners
- Blocks main thread with excessive monitoring
- Causes UI freezing and unresponsive navigation

### 2. Image Optimization Issues
**Problems**:
- Next.js image quality warnings: "quality '85' not configured in images.qualities"
- 400 Bad Request errors for missing images (funeral-wreaths-and-floral-arrangement-*.png)
- Large resource size (1.01MB) exceeding threshold (1024KB)

### 3. Performance Monitoring Overhead
**Issues**:
- Too verbose logging in development mode
- Performance threshold exceeded warnings
- Layout shift warnings for unsupported entryTypes

## Files Affected
- `src/components/product/ProductCard.tsx` (lines 44-50)
- `src/components/product/ProductGrid.tsx` (lines 45-55)
- `next.config.ts` (missing image qualities configuration)
- `src/lib/hooks/useCoreWebVitals.ts` (excessive logging)

## Solution Plan

### 1. Consolidate Core Web Vitals Tracking
- Move Core Web Vitals tracking to page level only
- Disable individual component tracking
- Use single instance for entire products page

### 2. Fix Image Configuration
- Add `qualities: [75, 85, 90, 95]` to Next.js config
- Handle missing images gracefully
- Optimize image loading strategy

### 3. Reduce Performance Monitoring
- Disable verbose logging in development
- Optimize performance thresholds
- Reduce monitoring overhead

### 4. Optimize Component Performance
- Fix useEffect dependencies in ProductGrid
- Implement proper debouncing
- Reduce re-renders

## Expected Outcome
- Responsive navbar navigation
- Reduced console logging
- Improved page performance
- Better user experience
