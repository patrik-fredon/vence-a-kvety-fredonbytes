# Environment Configuration Implementation

## Task Completed
Task 6: Environment Configuration and Documentation from the Stripe Embedded Checkout Enhancement spec.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Environment Variable Validation (`src/lib/config/env-validation.ts`)

Added validation for SMTP and admin email configuration:

#### SMTP Variables Added:
- `SMTP_HOST` - SMTP server host (required)
- `SMTP_PORT` - SMTP server port with numeric validation (required)
- `SMTP_USER` - SMTP authentication username (required)
- `SMTP_PASS` - SMTP authentication password (required)
- `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL` - Email address to send from with email format validation (required)
- `SMTP_FROM_NAME` - Display name for sent emails (required)

#### Admin Variables Added:
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` - Admin email address for order notifications with email format validation (required)

#### Security Enhancements:
- Added `SMTP_PASS` and `SMTP_USER` to sensitive keys list for sanitized logging
- Updated `logEnvironmentConfig()` to include SMTP_HOST, SMTP_FROM_EMAIL, and ADMIN_EMAIL

### 2. Created Comprehensive Documentation (`ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`)

Created a detailed environment variables documentation file covering:

- **Complete variable reference** with descriptions, formats, and examples
- **Setup instructions** for each service (Supabase, Stripe, Redis, SMTP)
- **Security best practices** for managing secrets
- **Troubleshooting guide** for common issues
- **Example .env file** with all required variables
- **Validation information** explaining how the app validates environment variables

## Validation

The implementation includes:
- Email format validation using regex for SMTP_FROM_EMAIL and ADMIN_EMAIL
- Port number validation for SMTP_PORT (1-65535)
- Clear error messages for missing or invalid variables
- Automatic validation on application startup

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ 9.1: All required environment variables documented
- ✅ 9.2: Environment validation implemented with clear error messages
- ✅ 9.3: Missing variable error messages provided
- ✅ 9.4: Stripe variables (including STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET) validated
- ✅ 9.5: SMTP configuration variables and ADMIN_EMAIL validated

## Notes

- Pre-existing TypeScript errors exist in `src/app/[locale]/checkout/success/page.tsx` but are unrelated to this implementation
- The env-validation.ts changes are syntactically correct and follow the existing pattern
- Documentation is comprehensive and includes troubleshooting for common setup issues
