# Task 11: Security Hardening - Completion Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Task**: Performance Optimization and Stripe Enhancement - Task 11: Security Hardening
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive security hardening for payment endpoints and API key management, addressing all requirements from Requirement 8 (Security and Compliance).

## Completed Subtasks

### 11.1 Rate Limiting for Payment Endpoints ✅

**Implementation**:
- Added payment-specific rate limiters to `src/lib/utils/rate-limit.ts`
- Applied rate limiting to `/api/payments/initialize` (10 requests per 5 minutes)
- Applied rate limiting to `/api/payments/webhook/stripe` (100 requests per minute)
- Returns proper 429 status with retry-after headers

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/utils/rate-limit.ts` - Added payment rate limiters
- `src/app/api/payments/initialize/route.ts` - Applied rate limiting
- `src/app/api/payments/webhook/stripe/route.ts` - Applied rate limiting

**Requirements Addressed**: 8.7

### 11.2 Update CSP Headers for Stripe ✅

**Implementation**:
- Verified CSP headers in `next.config.ts` already include all necessary Stripe domains
- No changes needed - already properly configured

**Stripe Domains Whitelisted**:
- `script-src`: `https://js.stripe.com`, `https://checkout.stripe.com`
- `frame-src`: `https://js.stripe.com`, `https://checkout.stripe.com`
- `connect-src`: `https://api.stripe.com`, `https://checkout.stripe.com`

**Requirements Addressed**: 8.2

### 11.3 Implement CSRF Protection ✅

**Implementation**:
- Applied CSRF validation to payment initialization endpoint
- Integrated CSRF token fetching in `PaymentFormClient.tsx`
- CSRF infrastructure already existed in `src/lib/security/csrf.ts`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/payments/initialize/route.ts` - Added CSRF validation
- `src/components/checkout/PaymentFormClient.tsx` - Added CSRF token to requests

**Requirements Addressed**: 8.6

### 11.4 Audit and Secure API Keys ✅

**Implementation**:
- Created comprehensive environment variable validation utility
- Added startup validation that runs before application starts
- Integrated validation into Stripe service initialization
- Verified no hardcoded API keys in codebase

**Files Created**:
- `src/lib/config/env-validation.ts` - Environment variable validation
- `src/lib/config/startup-validation.ts` - Startup validation runner
- `.kiro/specs/performance-optimization-and-stripe-enhancement/SECURITY_HARDENING.md` - Documentation

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/payments/stripe.ts` - Added environment validation
- `src/app/api/payments/webhook/stripe/route.ts` - Added webhook secret validation

**Validation Features**:
- Validates all required environment variables
- Checks format of API keys (sk_, pk_, whsec_ prefixes)
- Warns if test keys used in production
- Validates minimum length for secrets
- Sanitizes sensitive values in logs
- Fails fast in production if configuration invalid

**Requirements Addressed**: 8.4

## Security Improvements

### Rate Limiting
- ✅ Payment initialization: 10 requests per 5 minutes per IP
- ✅ Webhook endpoint: 100 requests per minute per IP
- ✅ Proper HTTP 429 responses with retry-after headers
- ✅ Redis-based distributed rate limiting

### CSRF Protection
- ✅ Token-based CSRF protection for payment forms
- ✅ Tokens expire after 1 hour
- ✅ Tokens include user context for validation
- ✅ Origin/referer validation

### CSP Headers
- ✅ Strict Content Security Policy
- ✅ Whitelisted Stripe domains only
- ✅ Frame-ancestors set to 'none'
- ✅ Upgrade-insecure-requests enabled

### API Key Security
- ✅ No hardcoded keys in codebase
- ✅ Environment variable validation
- ✅ Format validation for Stripe keys
- ✅ Production environment checks
- ✅ Sanitized logging of sensitive values

## Testing Performed

1. **Type Checking**: Verified new files compile without errors
2. **Code Review**: Confirmed no hardcoded API keys exist
3. **Integration**: Verified rate limiting and CSRF protection integrate correctly

## Documentation

Created comprehensive security documentation:
- `SECURITY_HARDENING.md` - Complete implementation guide
- Includes testing instructions
- Includes troubleshooting guide
- Includes deployment checklist

## Requirements Verification

All requirements from Requirement 8 (Security and Compliance) addressed:

- ✅ 8.1: Never log or store sensitive card information (Stripe Elements)
- ✅ 8.2: CSP headers configured for Stripe
- ✅ 8.3: Webhook signature verification (already implemented)
- ✅ 8.4: API keys use environment variables with validation
- ✅ 8.5: Error messages sanitized (already implemented)
- ✅ 8.6: CSRF protection implemented
- ✅ 8.7: Rate limiting implemented for payment endpoints

## Next Steps

For deployment:
1. Verify all environment variables are set in production
2. Ensure production Stripe keys are used (not test keys)
3. Test rate limiting with production Redis
4. Monitor rate limit analytics
5. Set up alerts for security events

## Notes

- Pre-existing TypeScript errors in other files are unrelated to this task
- CSRF infrastructure was already well-implemented, only needed integration
- CSP headers were already properly configured
- Rate limiting infrastructure existed, added payment-specific limiters
- Environment validation is comprehensive and production-ready
