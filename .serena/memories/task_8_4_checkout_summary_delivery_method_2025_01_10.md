# Task 8.4: Checkout Summary with Delivery Method - 2025-01-10

## Task Completed

Successfully implemented delivery method display in checkout summary for the product customization and checkout enhancements spec.

## Changes Made

### 1. CheckoutPageClient Component (`src/app/[locale]/checkout/CheckoutPageClient.tsx`)

**Added Helper Function:**
- Created `getDeliveryMethodFromCart()` function to extract delivery method from cart items' customizations
- Checks for `delivery_method` optionId in customizations
- Returns "delivery", "pickup", or null based on choiceIds

**Updated Component:**
- Added `tProduct` translation hook for product namespace
- Extracted `deliveryMethod` from cart items using helper function
- Added delivery method section in desktop summary (between items list and pricing)
- Displays appropriate information based on method:
  - **Delivery**: Shows label, description, and "Free delivery" badge
  - **Pickup**: Shows label, description, pickup address, and business hours
- Passed `deliveryMethod` prop to `CompactOrderSummary` for mobile view

### 2. OrderSummary Component (`src/components/checkout/OrderSummary.tsx`)

**Updated OrderSummary Interface:**
- Added optional `deliveryMethod?: "delivery" | "pickup" | null` prop

**Updated OrderSummary Component:**
- Added `tProduct` translation hook
- Added delivery method section before pricing breakdown
- Displays same information as desktop summary in CheckoutPageClient

**Updated CompactOrderSummary:**
- Added `deliveryMethod` prop to interface
- Added `tProduct` translation hook
- Added delivery method display at top of summary (before subtotal)
- Shows delivery method title, badge (for delivery), and method label

## Features Implemented

✅ **Display selected delivery method in summary**
- Shows in both desktop full summary and mobile compact summary
- Displays appropriate labels and descriptions from translations

✅ **Show delivery address or pickup location**
- For delivery: Shows "Free delivery" badge and description
- For pickup: Shows pickup address and business hours

✅ **Update summary when delivery method changes**
- Delivery method is derived from cart items state
- React automatically re-renders when items change
- Summary updates reactively

## Translation Keys Used

All translation keys already existed in `messages/cs.json` and `messages/en.json`:
- `product.deliveryMethod.title`
- `product.deliveryMethod.delivery.label`
- `product.deliveryMethod.delivery.description`
- `product.deliveryMethod.delivery.badge`
- `product.deliveryMethod.pickup.label`
- `product.deliveryMethod.pickup.description`
- `product.deliveryMethod.pickup.address`
- `product.deliveryMethod.pickup.hours`

## Technical Details

### Delivery Method Extraction Logic
```typescript
function getDeliveryMethodFromCart(items: CartItem[]): "delivery" | "pickup" | null {
  for (const item of items) {
    const deliveryCustomization = item.customizations?.find(
      (c) => c.optionId === "delivery_method"
    );
    if (deliveryCustomization && deliveryCustomization.choiceIds.length > 0) {
      const choiceId = deliveryCustomization.choiceIds[0];
      if (choiceId === "delivery_address") return "delivery";
      if (choiceId === "personal_pickup") return "pickup";
    }
  }
  return null;
}
```

### Styling Approach
- Used existing TailwindCSS classes with teal/amber color scheme
- Consistent with funeral-appropriate aesthetics
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Used bg-teal-50 for delivery method section background
- Used bg-green-100 for "Free delivery" badge

## Requirements Satisfied

- **Requirement 2.8**: Delivery method displayed in order summary and updates when changed
- **Requirement 9.6**: Delivery method information included in checkout display
- **Requirement 9.8**: Delivery/pickup details shown in summary

## Testing

✅ TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
✅ No diagnostic issues in modified files
✅ Proper type safety maintained throughout

## Integration Points

- Works with existing cart customization system
- Compatible with existing translation infrastructure
- Follows existing component patterns and styling
- Integrates seamlessly with CheckoutForm flow
