# Design Tokens Formatting - TypeScript Verification

## Date
2025-10-03

## Context
After formatting changes to `src/lib/design-tokens.ts` (specifically the mono font array), TypeScript type checking was performed to ensure no type errors were introduced.

## Changes Made
- Reformatted the `mono` font array in the `fontFamily` object to use multi-line format for better readability
- Changed from single-line array to multi-line array with proper indentation

## TypeScript Verification
**Command:** `npx tsc --noEmit`
**Result:** âœ… SUCCESS (Exit Code: 0)

## Analysis
- No type errors detected in the entire codebase
- The formatting change was purely cosmetic and did not affect type structure
- All type definitions remain valid and consistent
- The `as const` assertion on the fontFamily object continues to work correctly

## Files Verified
- `src/lib/design-tokens.ts` - Main file with changes
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Imports and uses design tokens
- All dependent files throughout the codebase

## Conclusion
The formatting change to the design tokens file is safe and does not introduce any TypeScript errors. The codebase maintains full type safety.
