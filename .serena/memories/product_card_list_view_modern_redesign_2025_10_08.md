# Product Card List View Modern Redesign - October 8, 2025

## Overview
Redesigned the list view layout for ProductCard component to create a clean, modern, and responsive design with improved visual hierarchy.

## Changes Made

### Layout Structure
- **Image Section (Left Half)**: Image now fills the entire left half of the card with full height
- **Content Section (Right Half)**: Restructured with clean, modern formatting

### Content Layout (Right Column)
1. **Product Name**: Large, bold text (text-xl to text-3xl responsive)
2. **Stock Badge**: Tag-style layout positioned in top-right corner
   - Green badge for in-stock items
   - Red badge for out-of-stock items
3. **Category**: Small text below product name
4. **Price**: Right-aligned, prominent size (text-2xl to text-3xl)
5. **Action Buttons**: Both buttons at bottom with equal height (h-12)
   - Customize/Add to Cart button (flex-1)
   - Quick View button (flex-1)
   - Both buttons centered and padded in the middle-bottom area

### Responsive Design
- Card height: h-64 (mobile) → h-72 (sm) → h-80 (md+)
- Text scales appropriately across breakpoints
- Buttons maintain consistent height and spacing
- Image always fills full height of card

### Visual Improvements
- Clean spacing with proper padding (p-4 sm:p-6)
- Flexbox layout for proper vertical alignment
- Stock badge uses rounded-full with color-coded backgrounds
- Price section right-aligned for visual balance
- Buttons use consistent styling and sizing

## Files Modified
- `src/components/product/ProductCard.tsx`

## Technical Details
- Removed old list view rendering logic
- Simplified image rendering for list view (no hover effects)
- Restructured content layout with flexbox
- Maintained accessibility features (aria-labels, semantic HTML)
- No TypeScript errors

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
2. Verify stock badge positioning
3. Check button alignment and equal heights
4. Validate image aspect ratio and fill behavior
5. Test with products that have/don't have images
6. Verify quick view and customize buttons work correctly
