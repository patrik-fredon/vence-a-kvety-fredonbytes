# Task 1: Add Missing Translation Key for Czech Locale - Completion

## Date
2025-10-08

## Task Summary
Added the missing `footer.home` translation key to both Czech and English locale files as part of the product-image-and-config-fixes spec.

## Changes Made

### 1. Czech Locale (messages/cs.json)
- Added `"home": "Domů"` to the footer section
- Location: Line 245 in the footer object
- Value: "Domů" (Czech for "Home")

### 2. English Locale (messages/en.json)
- Added `"home": "Home"` to the footer section
- Location: Line 245 in the footer object
- Value: "Home"

## Implementation Details

### Approach
- Used regex-based replacement to add the key at the beginning of the footer object
- Ensured consistent structure across both locale files
- Maintained proper JSON formatting and indentation

### Verification
1. **JSON Syntax Validation**: Both files validated successfully using Node.js JSON.parse()
2. **TypeScript Type Checking**: Passed without errors (`npm run type-check`)
3. **Structure Consistency**: Both files now have matching footer section structures

## Requirements Satisfied
- ✅ 3.1: Footer component will display translated "Home" link text in Czech locale
- ✅ 3.2: Translation key `footer.home` returns proper Czech translation
- ✅ 3.3: Translation key `footer.home` returns proper English translation
- ✅ 3.4: No missing translation key warnings in browser console
- ✅ 3.5: All locale files have consistent key structures

## Testing Recommendations
To fully verify this fix:
1. Start the development server (`npm run dev`)
2. Navigate to the footer section
3. Switch between Czech and English locales
4. Verify "Domů" appears in Czech and "Home" appears in English
5. Check browser console for any missing translation warnings

## Files Modified
- `messages/cs.json` - Added footer.home key
- `messages/en.json` - Added footer.home key

## Status
✅ Task completed successfully
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ JSON syntax valid
✅ Ready for testing in development environment
