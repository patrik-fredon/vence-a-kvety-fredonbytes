# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for migrating the current pohrebni-vence e-commerce application's user interface to match the design and layout from the `pohrebni-vence-layout` repository (<https://github.com/patrik-fredon/pohrebni-vence-layout>). This is a visual-only refactor that must preserve all existing business functionality, API integrations, caching mechanisms, and internationalization features while completely overhauling the user interface to match the target design.

The project serves Czech customers primarily with English language support, selling funeral wreaths and floral arrangements. The sensitive nature of the business requires maintaining a respectful, professional appearance throughout the migration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Visual Component Migration

1. WHEN a user visits the homepage THEN the system SHALL display the hero section, product highlights, and call-to-action elements matching the pohrebni-vence-layout design
2. WHEN a user navigates through the site THEN the system SHALL display consistent header and footer components that match the target layout
3. WHEN a user views any page THEN the system SHALL apply the typography, color scheme, and spacing from the pohrebni-vence-layout design system
4. WHEN a user interacts with UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback using the design patterns from pohrebni-vence-layout

### Requirement 2: Product Catalog Interface Update

5. WHEN admin users access the dashboard THEN the system SHALL maintain all administrative features while applying the new visual design

### Requirement 5: Internationalization Compatibility

**User Story:** As a Czech or English-speaking customer, I want to see the website in my preferred language with proper translations, so that I can understand all content and navigate effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user switches languages THEN the system SHALL display all UI text in the selected language (Czech or English) using existing translation keys
3. WHEN new UI components are added THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any hardcoded strings and SHALL use translation keys for all user-facing text
4. WHEN currency or date information is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain proper localization formatting for Czech and English locales

### Requirement 6: Responsive Design Implementation

**User Story:** As a customer using various devices, I want the updated design to work seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop, so that I can access the service from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the site on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized layout following mobile-first design principles
2. WHEN a user accesses the site on tablets THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately for medium-sized screens
3. WHEN a user accesses the site on desktop THEN the system SHALL provide the full desktop experience with optimal use of screen space
4. WHEN users interact with responsive elements THEN the system SHALL maintain touch-friendly interactions on mobile while supporting mouse interactions on desktop

### Requirement 7: Accessibility Standards Compliance
