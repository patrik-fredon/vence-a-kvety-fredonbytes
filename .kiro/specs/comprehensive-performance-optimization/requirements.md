# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive performance optimization initiative for the Next.js 15 e-commerce application. The goal is to optimize rendering speed, build performance, bundle size, and cross-browser/cross-device performance while maintaining production-ready code quality and visual appearance.

The application has already undergone initial optimizations (lazy loading, bundle splitting, Firefox compatibility), but there are significant opportunities for further improvements in CSS delivery, component architecture, font loading, database queries, and mobile performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: CSS and Styling Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want pages to load and render quickly without layout shifts, so that I have a smooth browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN critical CSS SHALL be inlined and non-critical CSS SHALL be deferred
2. WHEN TailwindCSS is built THEN unused CSS classes SHALL be purged to minimize bundle size
3. WHEN custom CSS is used THEN it SHALL be modularized using CSS Modules to enable better tree-shaking
4. IF the page uses custom fonts THEN font files SHALL be subset to include only used characters
5. WHEN CSS is delivered THEN it SHALL result in zero Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) during initial render

### Requirement 2: Component Architecture Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maximize the use of Server Components, so that the client-side JavaScript bundle is minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component does not require client-side interactivity THEN it SHALL be implemented as a Server Component
2. WHEN client components are necessary THEN they SHALL be lazy-loaded when not immediately visible
3. IF a component tree contains both server and client logic THEN the client boundary SHALL be pushed as deep as possible
4. WHEN components are refactored THEN the total number of "use client" directives SHALL be reduced by at least 30%
5. WHEN Server Components fetch data THEN they SHALL use streaming and Suspense boundaries for progressive rendering

### Requirement 3: Font Loading Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want text to be readable immediately without font-loading delays, so that I can start reading content quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fonts are loaded THEN they SHALL use font-display: swap to prevent invisible text
2. WHEN custom fonts are used THEN they SHALL be preloaded in the document head
3. IF fonts are from Google Fonts THEN they SHALL be self-hosted for better performance and privacy
4. WHEN font files are served THEN they SHALL be subset to include only Latin and Czech characters
5. WHEN fonts load THEN there SHALL be no more than 100ms of FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text)

### Requirement 4: Database and API Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want API responses to be fast and reliable, so that product pages and checkout load quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL use proper indexes on frequently queried columns
2. WHEN multiple related records are fetched THEN they SHALL use JOIN queries to avoid N+1 problems
3. IF an API route is called frequently THEN its response SHALL be cached with appropriate TTL
4. WHEN database connections are used THEN they SHALL use connection pooling to reduce overhead
5. WHEN API routes execute THEN they SHALL complete in less than 200ms for cached responses and less than 500ms for database queries

### Requirement 5: Image and Media Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want images to load quickly and not consume excessive bandwidth, so that pages load fast even on slower connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL use responsive srcset with appropriate sizes
2. WHEN images are below the fold THEN they SHALL be lazy-loaded with native loading="lazy"
3. IF images are critical (above the fold) THEN they SHALL be preloaded with fetchpriority="high"
4. WHEN images are served THEN they SHALL use modern formats (AVIF with WebP fallback)
5. WHEN product images are displayed THEN they SHALL have blur-up placeholders to prevent layout shift

### Requirement 6: Mobile Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the site to be fast and responsive on my device, so that I can shop efficiently on the go.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the site is accessed on mobile THEN it SHALL achieve a Lighthouse mobile score of 90+
2. WHEN mobile users interact THEN touch targets SHALL be at least 48x48px for accessibility
3. IF the viewport is mobile THEN unnecessary desktop-only features SHALL not be loaded
4. WHEN mobile pages render THEN they SHALL use mobile-first CSS with progressive enhancement
5. WHEN mobile users scroll THEN scroll performance SHALL maintain 60fps without jank

### Requirement 7: Third-Party Script Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want third-party scripts not to slow down the main application, so that I can interact with the site immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN third-party scripts are loaded THEN they SHALL use async or defer attributes
2. WHEN analytics scripts are needed THEN they SHALL be loaded after the main content is interactive
3. IF Stripe SDK is required THEN it SHALL only load on checkout pages, not globally
4. WHEN monitoring scripts run THEN they SHALL not block the main thread
5. WHEN third-party scripts fail THEN the application SHALL continue to function normally

### Requirement 8: Build and Bundle Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fast build times and optimized bundles, so that deployments are quick and users download minimal code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN the build time SHALL be under 2 minutes for production builds
2. WHEN JavaScript bundles are created THEN the main bundle SHALL be under 200KB gzipped
3. IF code is duplicated across chunks THEN it SHALL be deduplicated into shared chunks
4. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN bundle size SHALL be monitored and alerts SHALL trigger if it increases by more than 10%
5. WHEN the application is deployed THEN bundle analysis reports SHALL be generated automatically

### Requirement 9: Caching and CDN Strategy

**User Story:** As a user, I want frequently accessed resources to load instantly from cache, so that repeat visits are nearly instantaneous.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN static assets are served THEN they SHALL have cache headers with 1-year expiration
2. WHEN API responses are cacheable THEN they SHALL include appropriate Cache-Control headers
3. IF content changes frequently THEN it SHALL use stale-while-revalidate caching strategy
4. WHEN images are served THEN they SHALL be cached at the CDN edge with proper invalidation
5. WHEN service worker is implemented THEN it SHALL cache critical assets for offline access

### Requirement 10: Core Web Vitals Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want pages to load, become interactive, and remain stable quickly, so that I have an excellent user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) SHALL be under 2.5 seconds
2. WHEN users interact THEN First Input Delay (FID) SHALL be under 100 milliseconds
3. WHEN content renders THEN Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) SHALL be under 0.1
4. WHEN pages become interactive THEN Time to Interactive (TTI) SHALL be under 3.5 seconds
5. WHEN performance is measured THEN all Core Web Vitals SHALL be in the "Good" range for 75% of page loads

### Requirement 11: Cross-Browser Performance

**User Story:** As a user on any browser, I want consistent performance regardless of my browser choice, so that I have a reliable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the site is tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge THEN performance SHALL be within 10% variance
2. WHEN browser-specific features are used THEN they SHALL have appropriate fallbacks
3. IF a browser doesn't support a feature THEN the application SHALL gracefully degrade
4. WHEN CSS is parsed THEN there SHALL be no browser-specific warnings or errors
5. WHEN JavaScript executes THEN it SHALL use only features supported by the browserslist configuration

### Requirement 12: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor real-world performance metrics, so that I can identify and fix performance regressions quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users visit the site THEN Core Web Vitals SHALL be collected and reported
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN alerts SHALL be triggered for investigation
3. IF errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with context for debugging
4. WHEN performance is analyzed THEN real user monitoring (RUM) data SHALL be available
5. WHEN optimizations are deployed THEN before/after metrics SHALL be compared automatically
