## Testing Artifacts

### Files Created

1. `src/lib/utils/cross-browser-testing.ts` - Testing utility with browser detection and automated tests
2. `src/components/testing/CrossBrowserTestRunner.tsx` - Interactive test runner component
3. `.kiro/specs/vence-kvety-refactor/cross-browser-testing-results.md` - This documentation

### How to Use Testing Tools

#### Running Automated Tests

```typescript
import {
  runAllTests,
  generateTestReport,
} from "@/lib/utils/cross-browser-testing";

// Run all tests
const suite = runAllTests();

// Generate markdown report
const report = generateTestReport(suite);
console.log(report);
```

#### Using Test Runner Component

Add the component to a test page:

```tsx
import { CrossBrowserTestRunner } from "@/components/testing/CrossBrowserTestRunner";

export default function TestPage() {
  return <CrossBrowserTestRunner />;
}
```

#### Browser Detection

```typescript
import {
  detectBrowser,
  logBrowserInfo,
} from "@/lib/utils/cross-browser-testing";

// Detect current browser
const info = detectBrowser();

// Log to console
logBrowserInfo();
```

## Recommendations

### For Development

1. ✅ Continue using mobile-first responsive design
2. ✅ Leverage Next.js Image component for automatic format selection
3. ✅ Use CSS Grid and Flexbox (excellent support)
4. ✅ Test in Firefox periodically for clip-path rendering
5. ✅ Test on real iOS devices for viewport height behavior

### For Production

1. ✅ Serve WebP with JPEG/PNG fallbacks (already implemented)
2. ✅ Serve AVIF with WebP/JPEG fallbacks for Safari <16
3. ✅ Monitor performance on Safari for backdrop-filter effects
4. ✅ Ensure touch targets remain ≥44x44px
5. ✅ Test on iOS Safari regularly for address bar behavior

### Browser Support Policy

**Minimum Supported Versions**:

- Chrome/Edge: 90+
- Firefox: 88+
- Safari Desktop: 14+
- Safari Mobile (iOS): 14+

**Recommendation**: Display upgrade notice for older browsers
