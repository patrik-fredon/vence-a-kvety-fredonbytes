**Features:**

- Loads both Czech and English translation files
- Extracts and flattens all translation keys
- Compares keys between locales
- Identifies missing or extra keys
- Validates required critical keys
- Provides detailed reporting

**Usage:**

```bash
npx tsx scripts/verify-translations.ts
```

### 2. Runtime Translation Tester

**File:** `scripts/test-translations-runtime.ts`

**Purpose:** Tests actual translation key resolution

**Features:**

- Tests critical translation keys
- Validates key values are strings
- Checks for empty translations
- Detects fallback scenarios
- Provides per-locale statistics
- Generates comprehensive reports

**Usage:**

```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-translations-runtime.ts
```

### 3. Browser Testing Tool

**File:** `scripts/test-translations-browser.html`

**Purpose:** Interactive browser-based translation testing

**Features:**

- Visual interface for testing
- Tests both locales independently or together
- Real-time results display
- Success/failure indicators
- Summary statistics
- Console integration

**Usage:**

1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open `scripts/test-translations-browser.html` in browser
3. Click test buttons to verify translations

## Recommendations

### Maintenance

1. ✅ Run `scripts/verify-translations.ts` before each deployment
2. ✅ Add translation verification to CI/CD pipeline
3. ✅ Keep both locale files in sync when adding new keys
4. ✅ Use TypeScript types for translation keys to catch errors at compile time

### Best Practices

1. ✅ Always add keys to both `cs.json` and `en.json` simultaneously
2. ✅ Use descriptive key names that reflect content
3. ✅ Group related keys under common namespaces
4. ✅ Avoid hardcoded strings in components
5. ✅ Test translations in both locales before committing

### Future Enhancements

1. Add automated translation key type generation
2. Implement translation coverage reporting
3. Add visual regression testing for translated content
4. Create translation management dashboard
5. Add support for additional locales (DE, SK, etc.)

## Conclusion

All translation keys have been successfully verified and are working correctly in both Czech and English locales. The translation system is robust, complete, and ready for production use.

**No console errors are expected from missing translation keys.**
