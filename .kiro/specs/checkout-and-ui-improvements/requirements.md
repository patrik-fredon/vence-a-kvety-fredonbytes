# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical user experience issues in the checkout flow, shopping cart, and product display components. The improvements focus on form validation logic, image rendering consistency, visual layout optimization, and implementing a centralized background gradient system across the application. These changes will enhance usability, visual consistency, and professional appearance of the e-commerce platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Step Checkout Form Validation

**User Story:** As a customer completing checkout, I want the form to validate only the fields in the current step, so that I can progress through the checkout process without being blocked by fields I haven't reached yet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on step 1 of the checkout form THEN the system SHALL validate only the required fields visible in step 1
2. WHEN a user clicks "Next" to proceed to step 2 THEN the system SHALL NOT validate fields that belong to step 2 or later steps
3. WHEN a user reaches step 2 THEN the system SHALL validate step 2 required fields independently from other steps
4. IF validation fails for the current step THEN the system SHALL display error messages only for fields in that step
5. WHEN all required fields in the current step are valid THEN the system SHALL allow progression to the next step

### Requirement 2: Shopping Cart Product Image Display

**User Story:** As a customer viewing my shopping cart, I want to see product images for all items, so that I can visually confirm what I'm purchasing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the shopping cart THEN the system SHALL display the primary product image for each cart item
2. WHEN a product image is loading THEN the system SHALL display a loading placeholder with appropriate dimensions
3. IF a product image fails to load THEN the system SHALL display a fallback image or placeholder
4. WHEN the checkout page loads THEN the system SHALL display product images in the order summary section
5. WHEN images are rendered THEN the system SHALL use optimized image formats and lazy loading where appropriate

### Requirement 3: Product Grid Primary Image Display

**User Story:** As a customer browsing products, I want to see the primary product image on each product card, so that I can quickly identify products visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the product grid THEN the system SHALL display the primary image for each product card
2. WHEN a primary image is not available THEN the system SHALL display the first available image from the product's image array
3. IF no images are available THEN the system SHALL display a default placeholder image
4. WHEN images load THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent aspect ratios across all product cards
5. WHEN a user hovers over a product card THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback

### Requirement 4: Product Detail Image Layout Optimization

**User Story:** As a customer viewing product details, I want to see a professionally arranged image gallery, so that I can examine the product from multiple angles without visual clutter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the product detail page THEN the system SHALL display the main product image at an appropriate size that doesn't dominate the layout
2. WHEN multiple product images exist THEN the system SHALL arrange them in a professional grid layout with varying sizes
3. WHEN the image gallery is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure the total height does not exceed the right column content height
4. WHEN images are arranged THEN the system SHALL use a masonry or grid layout that is visually balanced
5. WHEN a user clicks on a thumbnail THEN the system SHALL update the main image smoothly

### Requirement 5: Shopping Cart Clear Functionality

**User Story:** As a customer managing my cart, I want a "Clear Cart" button, so that I can quickly remove all items without deleting them individually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the shopping cart with items THEN the system SHALL display a "Clear Cart" button
2. WHEN a user clicks "Clear Cart" THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before proceeding
3. WHEN the user confirms clearing the cart THEN the system SHALL remove all items from the cart
4. WHEN the cart is cleared THEN the system SHALL update the Redis cache to reflect the empty cart state
5. WHEN the cart is cleared THEN the system SHALL display a message confirming the action

### Requirement 6: Shopping Cart Redis Cache Synchronization

**User Story:** As a customer removing the last item from my cart, I want the item to be completely removed, so that it doesn't reappear when I refresh the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user removes the last item from the cart THEN the system SHALL delete the item from both local state and Redis cache
2. WHEN the cart becomes empty THEN the system SHALL update the Redis cache to reflect an empty cart state
3. WHEN a user refreshes the page after removing items THEN the system SHALL display the correct cart state from Redis
4. IF a cache synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and attempt to reconcile the state
5. WHEN cart operations complete THEN the system SHALL ensure Redis cache TTL is properly set

### Requirement 7: Centralized Background Gradient System

**User Story:** As a site visitor, I want to experience consistent visual branding across all pages, so that the site feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any page loads (except Hero and page headers) THEN the system SHALL apply the gold gradient background: `bg-[linear-gradient(to_right,_#AE8625,_#F7EF8A,_#D2AC47)]`
2. WHEN the Hero section loads THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing Teal background
3. WHEN page headers load (Checkout, Contact, Products, About Us) THEN the system SHALL use the Teal background
4. WHEN implementing the gradient THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS best practices with custom configuration
5. WHEN the gradient is applied THEN the system SHALL ensure proper contrast for text readability
6. WHEN defining the gradient THEN the system SHALL create a reusable Tailwind utility class in the configuration
7. WHEN components use backgrounds THEN the system SHALL reference the centralized gradient class rather than inline styles

### Requirement 8: Checkout Page Product Image Display

**User Story:** As a customer reviewing my order during checkout, I want to see product images in the order summary, so that I can verify I'm purchasing the correct items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the checkout page loads THEN the system SHALL display product images in the order summary section
2. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL use the same image source as the shopping cart
3. WHEN images load THEN the system SHALL show loading states with appropriate placeholders
4. IF an image fails to load THEN the system SHALL display a fallback image
5. WHEN the order summary is rendered THEN the system SHALL ensure images are properly sized and aligned with product information
