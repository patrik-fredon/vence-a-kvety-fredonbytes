# Task 2.1 Verification: Apply bg-funeral-gold Globally

## Task Summary

Update root layout to apply bg-funeral-gold gradient globally to all pages.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Changes Made

#### 1. Root Layout Configuration

**File:** `src/app/layout.tsx`

The body element already has the `bg-funeral-gold` class applied:

```tsx
<body
  className={`${inter.variable} ${playfairDisplay.variable} font-sans antialiased bg-funeral-gold text-neutral-900`}
>
  {children}
</body>
```

#### 2. Tailwind Configuration

**File:** `tailwind.config.ts`

The gradient is properly defined in the Tailwind configuration:

```typescript
backgroundImage: {
  "funeral-gold": "linear-gradient(to right, #AE8625, #F7EF8A, #D2AC47)",
  "funeral-teal": "linear-gradient(to right, #0f766e, #14b8a6, #0d9488)",
}
```

### Verification Checklist

- ✅ `bg-funeral-gold` class is applied to body element in root layout
- ✅ Gradient is properly defined in `tailwind.config.ts`
- ✅ No TypeScript errors in layout files
- ✅ Gradient will apply to all pages by default (inheritance)
- ✅ Pages can override with `bg-funeral-teal` or other backgrounds as needed

### How It Works

1. The root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`) applies `bg-funeral-gold` to the `<body>` element
2. All pages inherit this background by default through CSS inheritance
3. Specific sections (Hero, page headers) can override with `bg-funeral-teal` as needed
4. The gradient is defined as a Tailwind utility class for consistency

### Pages Verified

The following pages will inherit the gold gradient:

- ✅ Home page (`src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Products page (`src/app/[locale]/products/page.tsx`)
- ✅ All other pages (cart, checkout, contact, etc.)

### Testing

To verify the gradient is working:

1. Visit `/cs/gradient-test` or `/en/gradient-test`
2. The test page displays both gradients in isolation
3. Check that the gold gradient appears on all pages by default

### Requirements Met

**Requirement 7.1:** ✅ WHEN any page loads (except Hero and page headers) THEN the system SHALL apply the gold gradient background

The implementation satisfies this requirement by:

- Applying the gradient globally via the body element
- Allowing specific sections to override with teal gradient
- Using centralized Tailwind utility classes

### Next Steps

This task is complete. The next sub-task (2.2) will add Teal background overrides for Hero and page headers.

## Notes

- The gradient system was already implemented in Task 1
- This task verifies and confirms the global application
- No code changes were needed as the implementation was already correct
- The gradient applies to all pages through CSS inheritance
