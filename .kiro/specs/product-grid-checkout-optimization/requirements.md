# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical issues in the e-commerce platform's product grid functionality, image rendering, theming system, and checkout process. The goal is to create a production-ready, optimized user experience with modern development practices, proper routing functionality, consistent theming, and a streamlined checkout process focused solely on Stripe payments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Product Grid Routing Fix

**User Story:** As a customer browsing products, I want to click on any product card and be properly navigated to the product detail page, so that I can view complete product information and make a purchase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a product card in the product grid THEN the system SHALL navigate to the correct product detail page using the product slug
2. WHEN a user clicks on a product image in the grid THEN the system SHALL navigate to the product detail page
3. WHEN a user clicks on a product title in the grid THEN the system SHALL navigate to the product detail page
4. IF the product has customization options THEN the system SHALL redirect to the product detail page instead of adding directly to cart
5. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the URL SHALL follow the pattern `/{locale}/products/{product-slug}`
6. WHEN the product detail page loads THEN it SHALL display the correct product information matching the clicked product

### Requirement 2: Product Image Rendering Fix

**User Story:** As a customer browsing products, I want to see product images properly loaded from the database, so that I can visually evaluate products before making a purchase decision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the product grid loads THEN all product images SHALL be properly fetched from the database
2. WHEN a product has multiple images THEN the primary image SHALL be displayed in the grid
3. IF a product image fails to load THEN the system SHALL display a fallback placeholder image
4. WHEN images are loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
5. WHEN images load THEN they SHALL be optimized for performance with proper lazy loading
6. WHEN hovering over a product card THEN secondary images SHALL be displayed if available
7. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL maintain proper aspect ratios and responsive sizing

### Requirement 3: Modern Theming System Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want all colors and design tokens centralized in a modern theming system, so that the design is consistent, maintainable, and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the theming system THEN all hardcoded color classes SHALL be replaced with design tokens
2. WHEN using colors THEN they SHALL be defined in a centralized design tokens file
3. WHEN applying themes THEN the system SHALL support both light and dark mode variants
4. WHEN colors are used THEN they SHALL follow semantic naming conventions (primary, secondary, accent, etc.)
5. WHEN the theme is applied THEN it SHALL maintain the funeral-appropriate aesthetic with stone/amber palette
6. WHEN components use colors THEN they SHALL reference theme tokens instead of direct Tailwind classes
7. WHEN the design system is updated THEN changes SHALL propagate automatically across all components
8. WHEN accessibility is considered THEN color contrast ratios SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Requirement 4: Checkout Process Streamlining

**User Story:** As a customer making a purchase, I want a simple and reliable checkout process with only Stripe payment options, so that I can complete my order quickly and securely without confusion from multiple payment providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the checkout process THEN only Stripe payment options SHALL be available
2. WHEN the checkout loads THEN all GoPay references and components SHALL be removed
3. WHEN proceeding through checkout steps THEN the payment step SHALL only show Stripe payment form
4. WHEN payment processing occurs THEN it SHALL use only Stripe's secure payment infrastructure
5. WHEN payment is successful THEN the user SHALL be redirected to a success page with order confirmation
6. WHEN payment fails THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed with retry options
7. WHEN the checkout process is complete THEN it SHALL be production-ready with proper error handling
8. WHEN users interact with the checkout THEN the UI SHALL be intuitive and follow modern UX patterns

### Requirement 5: Code Quality and Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer and end user, I want the application to follow modern development practices and perform optimally, so that the codebase is maintainable and the user experience is smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing changes THEN all code SHALL follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
2. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL use proper React patterns and hooks
3. WHEN performance is measured THEN Core Web Vitals SHALL meet Google's recommended thresholds
4. WHEN images are loaded THEN they SHALL use Next.js Image optimization
5. WHEN the application builds THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript errors or warnings
6. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow the established code style conventions
7. WHEN components are tested THEN they SHALL handle error states gracefully
8. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL be production-ready with proper monitoring and logging
