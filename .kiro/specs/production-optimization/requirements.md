# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the comprehensive production optimization requirements for the Next.js 15 e-commerce funeral wreaths platform. The project currently has 957 TypeScript errors across 197 files and requires systematic optimization to achieve production-ready state while maintaining functionality. The optimization focuses on modern development approaches including dependency cleanup, type safety, performance improvements, and code quality enhancements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: TypeScript Type Safety and Error Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript errors resolved so that the application can build successfully with strict type checking enabled for production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run type-check` THEN the system SHALL return zero TypeScript errors
2. WHEN building for production THEN TypeScript checking SHALL be enabled (remove `ignoreBuildErrors: true`)
3. WHEN accessing environment variables THEN the system SHALL use bracket notation for process.env access
4. WHEN using optional properties THEN the system SHALL handle `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true` correctly
5. WHEN importing React hooks THEN all necessary imports SHALL be explicitly declared
6. WHEN using third-party libraries THEN all type definitions SHALL be properly imported and configured

### Requirement 2: Dependency Optimization and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused dependencies removed and imports optimized so that the bundle size is minimized and build performance is improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing package.json THEN the system SHALL identify and remove unused dependencies
2. WHEN scanning import statements THEN unused imports SHALL be automatically removed
3. WHEN using Radix UI components THEN only required components SHALL be imported (tree-shaking optimization)
4. WHEN importing utility libraries THEN the system SHALL use specific imports instead of barrel imports where beneficial
5. WHEN building the application THEN bundle analyzer SHALL show optimized chunk sizes
6. WHEN using development dependencies THEN they SHALL be properly categorized and not included in production builds

### Requirement 3: Modern Build Configuration and Performance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build configuration optimized with modern approaches so that the application loads faster and performs better in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL use the latest Next.js 15 optimization features
2. WHEN loading components THEN dynamic imports SHALL be used for non-critical components
3. WHEN bundling code THEN the system SHALL implement proper code splitting strategies
4. WHEN serving static assets THEN they SHALL be optimized with proper caching headers
5. WHEN loading images THEN they SHALL use modern formats (AVIF, WebP) with proper fallbacks
6. WHEN analyzing bundle size THEN critical path resources SHALL be under 244KB per chunk

### Requirement 4: Code Quality and Standards Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code quality standards enforced so that the codebase is maintainable and follows modern development practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running linting THEN Biome SHALL report zero errors and warnings
2. WHEN formatting code THEN the system SHALL use consistent formatting across all files
3. WHEN writing new code THEN it SHALL follow the established patterns and conventions
4. WHEN using async operations THEN proper error handling SHALL be implemented
5. WHEN accessing DOM elements THEN proper null checks SHALL be in place
6. WHEN using external APIs THEN proper type guards and validation SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 5: Performance Monitoring and Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive performance monitoring so that I can identify and resolve performance bottlenecks in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN Core Web Vitals SHALL be tracked and optimized
2. WHEN components render THEN performance metrics SHALL be collected without impacting user experience
3. WHEN images load THEN loading performance SHALL be monitored and optimized
4. WHEN JavaScript executes THEN execution time SHALL be tracked for optimization opportunities
5. WHEN users interact with the application THEN interaction metrics SHALL be recorded
6. WHEN performance issues occur THEN they SHALL be automatically detected and reported

### Requirement 6: Production Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper production environment configuration so that the application runs securely and efficiently in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to production THEN all environment variables SHALL be properly configured
2. WHEN serving the application THEN security headers SHALL be properly set
3. WHEN handling errors THEN they SHALL be logged appropriately without exposing sensitive information
4. WHEN caching resources THEN proper cache strategies SHALL be implemented
5. WHEN monitoring the application THEN health checks and monitoring endpoints SHALL be available
6. WHEN scaling the application THEN it SHALL handle concurrent users efficiently

### Requirement 7: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing coverage so that I can deploy with confidence that functionality is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN all existing functionality SHALL continue to work as expected
2. WHEN testing components THEN accessibility compliance SHALL be verified
3. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN proper error handling SHALL be validated
4. WHEN testing user flows THEN critical paths SHALL be covered with integration tests
5. WHEN testing performance THEN benchmarks SHALL be established and maintained
6. WHEN testing in different environments THEN the application SHALL work consistently

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation of optimizations so that future maintenance and improvements can be made efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizations are implemented THEN they SHALL be documented with rationale and impact
2. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN they SHALL be explained in comments and documentation
3. WHEN performance improvements are achieved THEN metrics SHALL be recorded for future reference
4. WHEN new patterns are established THEN they SHALL be documented for team consistency
5. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN diagnostic information SHALL be readily available
6. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN optimization strategies SHALL be clearly explained
