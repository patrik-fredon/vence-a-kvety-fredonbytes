# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses comprehensive performance optimization and modern Stripe payment integration for the funeral wreaths e-commerce platform. The project currently has basic Stripe implementation but requires modernization to align with Next.js 15 best practices, latest Stripe APIs, and performance optimization standards. The optimization will focus on reducing load times, eliminating code duplication, removing unused files, and implementing modern development practices while maintaining all existing functionality.
