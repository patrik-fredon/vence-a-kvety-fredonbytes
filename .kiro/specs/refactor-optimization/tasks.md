  - Set up performance regression testing in CI/CD pipeline
  - _Requirements: Technical Req 6 (testing enhancement)_

- [ ] 14. Final integration and validation
  - Integrate all refactored components and ensure compatibility
  - Perform comprehensive testing of all functionality
  - Validate performance improvements and bundle size reduction
  - Conduct accessibility audit and compliance verification
  - Document changes and create deployment checklist
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation and integration_

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach

- Each task should be completed with proper testing before moving to the next
- Maintain existing functionality while implementing improvements
- Use feature flags where appropriate to enable gradual rollout
- Follow atomic commits with clear descriptions of changes

### Quality Gates

- All tasks must pass existing tests before completion
- New functionality must include appropriate test coverage
- Performance improvements must be measurable and validated
- Accessibility compliance must be maintained throughout

### Dependencies

- Tasks 1-2 provide foundation for all subsequent work
- Tasks 3-8 can be worked on in parallel after foundation is complete
- Tasks 9-11 require completion of component refactoring (tasks 3-8)
- Tasks 12-13 can be integrated throughout the development process
- Task 14 requires completion of all previous tasks

This implementation plan ensures systematic improvement of both technical performance and user experience while maintaining the professional, empathetic tone appropriate for funeral wreath commerce.
