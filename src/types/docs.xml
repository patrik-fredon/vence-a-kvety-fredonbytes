ISSUE DESCRIPTION (enhanced & corrected)
----------------------------------------
I suspect an incorrect implementation in the TypeScript files that load product images. These files should load images from Supabase. The `images` column in Supabase is a JSONB array formatted like the example below. Each image object contains an `alt`, a `url`, and an `isPrimary` boolean. The application must:

```
- Parse the JSONB `images` column reliably as an array of objects.
- Render the image marked with `isPrimary: true` as the primary image on the product card.
- If no image is marked primary, fall back to the first image in the array.
- Use the `alt` field for accessibility and SEO.
- Handle missing or malformed data gracefully.

SAMPLE JSONB (array of image objects)
-------------------------------------
[
  {
    "alt": "Classic white round funeral wreath",
    "url": "https://cdn.fredonbytes.com/circular-funeral-wreath-white-roses-yellow-carnations-green-anthuriums.webp",
    "isPrimary": true
  },
  {
    "alt": "Detail 1: Classic white round funeral wreath",
    "url": "https://cdn.fredonbytes.com/circular-funeral-wreath-white-roses-yellow-carnations-green-anthuriums-detail-1.webp",
    "isPrimary": false
  },
  {
    "alt": "Detail 2: Classic white round funeral wreath",
    "url": "https://cdn.fredonbytes.com/circular-funeral-wreath-white-roses-yellow-carnations-green-anthuriums-detail-2.webp",
    "isPrimary": false
  },
  {
    "alt": "White ribbon with gold border",
    "url": "https://cdn.fredonbytes.com/beige-satin-ribbon-marble-surface-dark-background.webp",
    "isPrimary": false
  },
  {
    "alt": "Black ribbon with gold edges",
    "url": "https://cdn.fredonbytes.com/black-gold-ribbon-funeral-wreath.webp",
    "isPrimary": false
  },
  {
    "alt": "Black classic ribbon",
    "url": "https://cdn.fredonbytes.com/charcoal-satin-ribbon-natural-light.webp",
    "isPrimary": false
  },
  {
    "alt": "The florist creates a wreath",
    "url": "https://cdn.fredonbytes.com/florist-hands-arranging-lilies-closeup.webp",
    "isPrimary": false
  }
]

TASKS (what to do)
-------------------
1. Debug and analyze the front-end and data-fetching TypeScript files that could affect primary image rendering on the Product page. Typical candidate files to inspect:
   - Product page entry (e.g., `pages/products`, `app/products/page.tsx`)
   - Product list and grid components (`ProductGrid.tsx`)
   - Product card and image components (`ProductCard.tsx`, `ProductImage.tsx`, `ProductImageHover.tsx`)
   - Supabase fetching utilities or lib (e.g., `lib/supabase/*.ts`)
   - Any server-side functions, API routes, or edge handlers that fetch product rows

2. Use Chrome DevTools to:
   - Inspect network responses from Supabase and confirm the `images` payload shape.
   - Inspect component props and React tree to confirm which data is passed to ProductCard/ProductImage.
   - Place breakpoints or console logs to trace where the `images` column is parsed or transformed.
   - Reproduce the issue and capture console warnings (e.g., Next/Image "fill" with parent height 0).

3. Implement a modern, robust fix that includes:
   - Strong TypeScript types for `ProductImage` and `Product`.
   - Safe parsing of JSONB `images` (handle stringified JSON in some cases).
   - Selection logic: pick `images.find(i => i.isPrimary)` or fallback to `images[0]`.
   - Proper Next.js `Image` usage: ensure the parent container has an explicit height or use width/height props to avoid "height 0" warnings.
   - Graceful fallback UI when no images are available.
   - Error handling and logging for malformed image entries.

4. Optimization & best practices to apply:
   - Prefer server-side fetching or edge functions when appropriate to avoid client-side parsing issues and to leverage CDN caching.
   - Normalize image URLs (ensure protocol and domain correctness) before rendering.
   - Use `sizes` and `priority` on critical images where beneficial.
   - Add lightweight image placeholder (blurDataURL or CSS) for perceived performance.
   - Add unit tests (Jest / Testing Library) for the image selection logic and integration tests for ProductCard rendering if project supports them.

5. Deliverables
   - Precise list of edited files and code diffs / patch files.
   - TypeScript code snippets that implement the fix (data fetch + mapping + ProductCard rendering).
   - Unit tests covering primary vs fallback image selection.
   - DevTools notes and sample network payloads used for debugging.
   - Changelog entry and workspace memory update summarizing the fix, rationale, and test results.
   - If any keys or messages were impacted, include i18n notes.

CONSTRAINTS & GUIDELINES
------------------------
- Preserve import and runtime sequence to avoid breaking application imports.
- Avoid naming or hard-coding internal tool servers; use workspace tool abstractions for project memory, code execution, and research.
- Log all decisions and intermediate findings in the workspace memory/store for traceability.
- Keep all code changes strongly typed and add small, focused tests for behavior verification.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE (how agent should act)
------------------------------------------
- Start with a sequential analysis step to identify the exact file(s) where `images` is transformed.
- Use Chrome DevTools to verify the raw Supabase response and the object actually received by React components.
- Apply the minimal, well-tested code change that corrects parsing and rendering.
- Run tests and perform manual verification in the browser to ensure:
  * Primary image displays when `isPrimary: true`.
  * Fallback image displays when no primary exists.
  * No "height 0" warnings for Next/Image `fill` usage.
- Save a detailed changelog to the workspace memory and prepare a concise PR description.

OUTPUT FORMAT EXPECTED
----------------------
- Provide a step-by-step summary of findings and exact patches (diffs) or file contents to be applied.
- Include example TypeScript snippets for `fetchProducts`, `ProductImage` selection, and `ProductCard` rendering.
- Include test examples (unit test for the image selection helper).
- End with verification checklist and the changelog entry.
